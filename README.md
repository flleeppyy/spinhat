# FAQ

## What is Spinhat?

Spinhat is an Electron client mod for Reason's Reason+ Companion app (RPC), which is built on Electron.
It's inspired from other Electron client mods such as Powercord, BetterDiscord, and a few others.

## What is Spinhat's goal?

Spinhat's goal is to add features and optimizations to RPC, such as the ability to add custom stylesheets, custom loading screens, new UI features, etc.

## Why?

I wanted to try making a client mod for an application, and I saw RPC as a nice opportunity to learn Electron, and app injecting.
I know that most people wont want be using this client, but decided on making this anyway.

## Why not just ask Reason Studios to add certain features?

The Reason Studios team aims to make an application that allows musicians to upgrade, install, and remove extensions in an easy to use way, in addition with weekly free sound packs. Small things like a customized loading screen, custom stylesheets, and other cool features that Spinhat aims to add, is not a part of Reason Studios' things-to-add-list (for lack of a better term).

## Is MacOS supported?

No it is not, but that is soon to change once we can figure out how to integrate our patcher with the app, and add filesystem support to Spinhat

## Can I get rack extensions/Reason+ for free?

No. If you're looking for a client mod that has ill-intent with getting around paywalls and getting free rack extensions or a free Reason+ subscription, you're not going to find one. This is an Improvement Project, it aims to add optimizations and new features to RPC. We have no malicious intent.

## Will this client get my Reason account terminated?

As far as we know, __*No*__, but that may change in the future if Reason Studios decides to start checking for modifications to the client,in which case we will simply take down Spinhat and its patcher.
